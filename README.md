# Mockup Generator from template

I have implemented 2 solutions for this.

## Solution 1 (draft to brainstorm)

- Get pre defined coordinates
- Get pre defined size of frame
- Insert picture to frame

## Solution 2 ( not ideal, but good enough )

- Convert the frame to grayscale easier processing.
- Detect edges
- Extract contours from the edges   to locate the frame
- Approximate the frame's contour
- Sort the detected corners of the frame to maintain a consistent order
- Calculate slightly inset corners to leave the frame borders intact.
- Generate a mask of the inset area where the photo will be placed.
- Combine photo and frame
